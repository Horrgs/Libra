# Libra

## What is Project Libra?

Project Libra was a codename for this project as it was originally a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. An old Galaxy tablet in a home-made picture frame connected over VNC to a Raspberry Pi running this project.

Project Libra uses your Google account to fetch a specific album and create a slideshow. This way, it is easier for more photos to be added and removed just through Google. 

# Current Operation

This project is operational, but designed in the way towards me. Currently, it'll look for an album called 'Libra'. In the future, I plan on making this more user-friendly and adjustable for others to uuse.

## Future Tasks

* finish cache.
* setup settings page
* smooth transition for slideshow
* mmake slideshow continue when it reaches end of list.
